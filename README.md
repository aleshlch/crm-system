## CRM System

On the main page of this web application it is possible to add an unlimited number of customer requests. Requests are added to the server made with Glitch. The catalog tab displays a table with data, where it is also possible to sort requests by status and product name. When refreshing the page sort values are saved. Each request can be edited and deleted. It also provides for changing the theme of the site, which is dark by default.
